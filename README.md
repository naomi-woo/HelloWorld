# 📁 HelloWorld! – Bulletin Board Web App for Computer Engineering Students

> A Django-based interactive platform for CE students to share class insights, code, and career tips — curated by Naomi Woo with major independent contributions.

<br/>
<br/>

## 🧩 1. Project Overview

**HelloWorld!** is a bulletin board-style web platform created to foster academic and career-driven exchange among computer engineering students. With a focus on peer-to-peer interaction, the site supports file sharing, code snippets, and job experience posts to enhance both learning and motivation.

Initially designed as a team project for a university course, Naomi took on a lead role and executed nearly all functional aspects independently — from backend architecture to frontend UI.

## 🔍 2. Background & Motivation

While many students rely on scattered resources during their CE studies, **HelloWorld!** aims to centralize key information in a dedicated community platform. It encourages knowledge-sharing across universities, and eventually aims to bridge the gap between current students, alumni, and professionals by:

- Promoting discussions on classes and code.
- Providing insights on competitions and career paths.
- Building a CE-exclusive ecosystem modeled after blog communities like Tistory (a popular Korean blogging site).

## 🧑‍💻 6. My Role

Although this was a team project, I independently built and deployed most of the key features:
- Designed the database schema and implemented Django models
- Built dynamic views and user authentication features
- Styled the UI using Bootstrap, referencing Tistory layouts
- Managed Git versioning and wrote technical documentation

<br/>

## 🚀 7. Future Vision

Plans for further development include:
- Adding real-time chat or discussion forums
- Expanding the target audience to include alumni and industry mentors
- Migrating to a scalable database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Deploying to a public domain for live use
